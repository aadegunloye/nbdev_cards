## How to use

This lib provides a [`Card`](https://aadegunloye.github.io/nbdev_cards/card.html#card) class you can use to create, display, and compare playing cards:

::: {#cell-14 .cell execution_count=2}
``` {.python .cell-code}
Card(1,3)
```

::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=2}
```
3♦
```
:::
:::


Suits are numbered according to this list:

::: {#cell-16 .cell execution_count=3}
``` {.python .cell-code}
suits
```

::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=3}
```
['♣', '♦', '♥', '♠']
